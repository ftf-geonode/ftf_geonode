# Introduction

This directory is used to store static assets for your project. User media files
(FileFields/ImageFields) are not stored here.

The convention for this directory is:

 * css/ — stores CSS files
 * less/ — stores LESS files
 * js/ — stores Javascript files
 * img/ — stores image files


#Gulp

Gulp can be used to automatically compile less files into css.  To install gulp do the following.

1.  CD into this directory and install dependencies with `npm install`
2.  Install gulp globally for all users with `sudo npm install -g gulp`

After installing, you can run Gulp simply with `gulp` and the process will watch your less files for changes.
